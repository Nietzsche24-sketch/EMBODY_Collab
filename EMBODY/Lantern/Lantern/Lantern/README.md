**DIY Data Recovery, Sorting & Preview System — 100% Free, Fully Yours**

Lantern is a free, open-source alternative to overpriced recovery software like Disk Drill. It uses raw recovery tools under the hood (like PhotoRec) and adds smart file sorting, renaming, deduplication, and media preview — all in a clean local pipeline you control.

No license. No lock-in. No bullshit.
